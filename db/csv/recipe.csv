162,Frozen Chocolate Banana Pops with Almonds & Malted Coconut Honey,"In a blender or food processor, combine the bananas, almond butter, Almond Breeze, honey and vanilla. Blend until completely smooth and creamy. Make sure the almond butter is completely mixed, it can stick to the sides and bottom of the food processor sometimes.

Pour the mixture among 8 popsicle molds or paper dixie cups. Place popsicle sticks in the center of each mold. Place the molds in the freezer and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.

About 30 minutes prior to removing the pops from the freezer, make the malted honey (if making). Place the Almond Breeze, honey (or sugar), coconut oil and malted milk powder in a large sauce pan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, whisking frequently and cook for 8-­10 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat and allow to cool 15 minutes before dipping the pops.

To remove the popsicles run the mold under hot water for 10 seconds and then pull the popsicles out of the mold.

Working with one pop at a time, dip just one side of the pop in the honey sauce and allow the excess to drip off. Place the pop, dipped side up (so no honey sauce really touches the wax paper) on a wax lined baking sheet and put in the freezer. If you dip the whole in the sauce, it is just a little bit harder to get the pops off the wax paper without peeling away the honey sauce. Repeat with the remaining pops and freeze for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the chocolate shell. Combine the chopped chocolate and coconut oil in a medium sauce pan over medium heat. Stir frequently until chocolate is almost melted. Remove from heat and stir until completely melted and smooth. Allow to cool 15-20 minutes before dipping the pops.

Remove the pops from the freezer one at a time and dip in the chocolate shell. Quickly sprinkle with chopped almonds (consider our low salt snack almonds for a low sodium option), coconut and a little salt.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1152748-556x370.jpg,1152748,2022-11-13 05:18:43 UTC,2022-11-13 05:18:43 UTC,842

174,Vegan Chocolate Tart (No Soy!),"Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350ºF and have a 9-inch pie plate ready. To make the crust, process the hazelnuts until coarsely ground in a food processor. Add in the oil, maple syrup, salt, oat flour, and oats, and process again until the dough comes together. The dough should stick together slightly when pressed between your fingers. If it's too dry, try adding 1 teaspoon water or processing it a bit longer.

Transfer the dough to the base of the pie dish. Starting from the middle, press the mixture firmly and evenly into the dish, moving outward and upward along the side of the pie dish. The harder you press the crumbs into the dish, the better the crust will hold together. Bake uncovered until lightly golden, about 15 to 20 minutes at 350ºF.

To make the filling, drain and rinse the cashews. In a high-speed blender, combine the soaked cashews, maple syrup, oil, cocoa powder, melted chocolate, vanilla, and salt. Blend on high until the filling is completely smooth. It can take a few minutes of blending to get it smooth, depending on your blender. If the blender needs more liquid to get it going, add a tablespoon or more of water, as needed, to help it along.

Pour the filling into the prepared crust, scooping every last bit out of the container. Smooth out the top evenly. Place the pie dish on a flat surface in the freezer, uncovered. Freeze for 1-2 hours, and then cover the dish and transfer it to the fridge until ready to serve.

Slice and serve the pie chilled, with your favorite garnishes, like coconut whipped cream and shaved chocolate. I find that it's easier to cut into this pie when served from the fridge, but keep in mind that it will become softer if it's left at room temperature for too long. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1558085-556x370.jpg,1558085,2022-11-13 05:18:47 UTC,2022-11-13 05:18:47 UTC,505

177,3-Ingredient Nutty Banana Cookies,"Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Transfer the raw nuts to a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped. If you don't have a food processor (or a high-powered blender), you can easily chop the nuts by hand using a knife and cutting board.

3. Mash the ripe bananas in a mixing bowl until creamy (it’s okay to leave some small chunks).

4. Stir in the almond butter until well-combined. Add in the chopped nuts and stir well.

5. If adding chocolate chips, do so now and stir until a thick gooey dough forms. This cookie dough is meant to be very sticky and won’t resemble regular cookie dough - this is normal.

6. Use a spoon to drop mounds of dough onto the parchment-lined cookie sheet. The cookie dough won’t spread and it will retain its shape during the baking process, so form it into the shapes you want to end up with - I stick with round cookie shapes.

7. Bake on the center rack of the oven for 10 to 17 minutes (I do 15), until the cookies are golden-brown and have set up. The timing is dependent on how large the cookies are. For small cookies, bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Bake larger cookies for 15 to 17 minutes.

8. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool for 20 minutes on the cookie sheet before digging in.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1711279-556x370.jpg,1711279,2022-11-13 05:18:48 UTC,2022-11-13 05:18:48 UTC,149

Stir in the sweet condensed milk, evaporated milk and salt. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring often, until thickened, about 20 minutes. As the mixture starts thickening, it’s important to stir constantly, to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

When the rice pudding has thickened, add the vanilla extract and mix to combine. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

To assemble the individual portions, spoon some dulce de leche in the bottom of glasses, individual dessert bowls or shooters. Add a few spoonfuls of rice pudding. Continue alternating the layers, finishing with a generous layer of rice pudding.

192,Low-Carb Lemon Cheesecake Bars,"Place the raw cashews in a bowl and fill with water (2 inches above the line of cashews) so that they’re completely covered. Soak overnight (at least 8 hours).

Note: You can speed up this process by soaking the cashews in boiling water for 2 hours.

Add the ingredients for the crust to a food processor and process until completely combined and the nuts are chopped into tiny pieces. You may need to add 1 to 3 additional tablespoons of coconut oil depending on the consistency of the crust - you want it to press together easily like a dough but not be overly oily.

Line a 8”x8” or 9”x9” square baking pan with parchment paper and transfer the crust mixture to it. Use your hands to press the crust mixture into the bottom of the pan, creating an even layer.

Drain and rinse the cashews then transfer them to a high-powered blender (they can be moist - they don’t need to be completely dry). Add the rest of the ingredients for the filling to the blender and blend until completely smooth. You may need to stop the blender a couple of times, scrape the sides with a rubber spatula and get it going again in order to get the consistency completely creamy.

197,Vegan Zucchini Bread,"Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F.

Grate the zucchini and place in a strainer to drain. You can squeeze it with your hand or use a spatula to press it against the side of the strainer to remove excess liquid. Alternatively, wrap the grated zucchini up in a dish cloth and squeeze out excess water. 

Add the dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg and salt) to a large mixing bowl and stir well to combine. Make sure no clumps remain and the baking powder and baking soda have been thoroughly incorporated.

Add the drained grated zucchini to the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula until the pieces are distributed and coated in flour.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients (coconut oil, yogurt, applesauce, vanilla and maple syrup). Note that it is important these are all room temperature otherwise the coconut oil will solidify. If you only have chilled applesauce and yogurt, warm them briefly in the microwave until they come to room temperature. If you’re using an alternative oil, no need to worry if the ingredients are chilled.

Making a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, pour in the wet ingredients and gently fold together until all of the flour has been wetted, taking care not to over work the batter.

Lastly, fold in the crushed walnuts

Lightly spray a loaf pan (see notes for sizing) with non-stick cooking spray then scoop the batter into the pan and shake or spread to even it out.

Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.

Let the loaf cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes then run a knife along the sides and carefully flip out the pan.

198,Homemade Chocolate Dessert Cups,"Blow up 12 balloons, inflating them only to the point that the bottom 1/3 of the balloon will be the perfect size for a chocolate cup. You definitely won’t inflate the balloon to it’s full capacity. Gently wash the balloons with warm water and let them dry completely (to avoid seizing the chocolate with little drops of water). Set the balloons aside.Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl in the microwave, taking care not to overheat the chocolate or it will seize and harden. If you want to avoid the white “blooming” lines that can appear in dried chocolate, reserve about 2 tablespoons of unmelted chocolate and stir it into the warm, melted chocolate until all the chocolate bits are melted and smooth. This is a quick and dirty way to temper chocolate.Take a balloon and press it into the chocolate so the chocolate comes about 1/3 of the way up the balloon. Set the balloon on a lined baking sheet to dry. Once all the balloons have been dipped, allow the chocolate to set in a cool location (like the refrigerator or a cool storage room or non-fumy garage). Don’t discard the chocolate until you have removed the balloons from the cups, in case there is any breakage that can be repaired. Once the chocolate has set, bring the trays of balloons to room temperature and let them sit for 5 minutes or so. You don’t want the chocolate to soften too much, but you want to take the chill off a little bit.Carefully snip a tiny cut in the top of the balloon, holding on to the balloon, and avoiding a huge cut (this could cause the chocolate to shatter). The goal is slow and easy here. Let the balloon gently deflate. When it has released all the air, gently press the bottom of the balloon while peeling the balloon away from the chocolate. Again slow and easy. If you use your fingers to press down on the balloon while peeling it away from the edge, it will help the process.Once the balloon is completely removed, store the chocolate cups in a cool location until ready to use. If a chocolate cup (or ten) ends up with a hole in the bottom, never fear. Simply dollop a small spoonful of leftover chocolate over the hole and let it set.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/569282-556x370.jpg,569282,2022-11-13 05:18:54 UTC,2022-11-13 05:18:54 UTC,459

220,Baked Vegan Cheesecake,"Instructions

For the crust

Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan with coconut oil and place on a baking sheet.

In a food processor or high-powered blender, combine the pecans, almond flour, coconut sugar, cinnamon, and sea salt. Pulse slightly to break up the pecans. Stream in the melted coconut oil and then pulse again until the mixture is well moistened and sticks together when pressed between your fingertips. Scrape down the sides of the container or use the tamper as necessary. 

Press the crust evenly along the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes or until firm to the touch. Let cool while you make the filling.

For the cheesecake filling

Reduce the oven temperature to 325.

In a high-powered blender or a food processor (I use my Vitamix), blend the soaked cashews, coconut cream, coconut yogurt, maple syrup, fresh lemon juice, arrowroot starch, vanilla extract, sea salt, and vanilla bean powder. Scrape down the sides of the container or use the tamper as necessary to get a super smooth consistency. It will take about 3 to 5 minutes of blending to get it super smooth and creamy.

Taste the mixture and adjust to your tastes (add more maple syrup for sweetness, lemon juice for tanginess, or vanilla extract for more vanilla flavor). Pour the filling into the cooled crust and tap the pan hard on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles.

Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until mostly set. The cheesecake should jiggle slightly in the center when it's ready, but not be too wet and jiggly. Try not to disturb the cheesecake for the first 45 minutes.

When the cheesecake is just shy of set, turn off the oven, leaving the cheesecake inside. Leave the oven door open a few inches and let the cheesecake cool inside of the slightly ajar oven. Remove from the oven after about an hour.

Chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour to chill all the way through.

For the strawberries & to serve

When you're about ready to serve, combine the strawberries and coconut sugar in a bowl. Let the strawberries macerate for about 10 minutes. Just before serving, top the cheesecake with the strawberries. It's also great served with coconut whipped cream or any other fruit that you prefer.

Store the cheesecake tightly wrapped in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1110882-556x370.jpg,1110882,2022-11-13 05:19:01 UTC,2022-11-13 05:19:01 UTC,492

Microwave chocolate and butter in a large microwave-safe bowl at medium (50% power) for 3-4 minutes or until butter is melted.

While the chocolate is melting, prepare the pumpkin layer. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, pumpkin puree, sugar, pumpkin pie spice and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer well combined and smooth. Set aside.

Once the butter is melted, remove the bowl from the microwave and stir until chocolate is melted. Whisk in sugar, eggs, vanilla and salt. Gradually add in flour; stir until just combined.

Spread 3/4 of the batter into prepared pan. Spoon pumpkin filling by tablespoonfuls evenly over batter. Spoon remaining brownie batter over filling. Use a knife or wooden skewer to cut through the batter several times in different directions to create a swirled pattern. Bake in preheated oven for 30-35 minutes - do not over-bake.

Remove to cooling rack to cool completely. Before serving, prepare the ganache.

To make the ganache, pour the chopped chocolate into a medium mixing bowl, set aside. Pour the heavy cream into a microwave-safe measuring cup (Pyrex) and microwave on high for about 1 minute or until bubbles begin to form on the surface. Take care to not overheat because the cream will boil over. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and allow it to sit for about 3 minutes. Use a small whisk to combine the mixture into a smooth chocolate glaze.

237,Christmas pudding cake pops,"Pulse the madeira cake in a food processor until you have fine crumbs. Melt the white chocolate in a bowl over just simmering water or in the microwave. Shop bought madeira cake can vary in texture so you may need to add a little extra melted white chocolate to make the mixture stick into balls. Stir the orange zest into the chocolate, then work the chocolate into the crumbs using your hands.
Form into 10 small truffle-sized balls, then roll gently in your palms to smooth the surface. Arrange the balls on a baking parchment-lined dinner plate. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the mixture to set.
Melt the dark chocolate in a microwave or over a bowl of just simmering water. Dip a lolly stick into the melted chocolate about 1.5cm in and poke half way into a cake ball. Repeat with the remaining balls. Put them back on the plate. Return to the fridge for five minutes.
Dip the cake pops one at a time into the melted chocolate, allowing any excess chocolate to drip off and spin the pops to even out the surface. Poke the pops into a piece of polystyrene or cake pop holder if you have one, keeping the pops apart. Allow to set for about half an hour.
Heat the white chocolate in a microwave or over a pan of simmering water. Allow to cool for a few minutes until it has a thick, runny consistency. If the chocolate is too hot, it will melt the dark chocolate underneath so make sure you do not overheat it. Spoon a small amount on top of the cake pops and tip them back and forth so that it runs down the sides a little. If you have holly decorations, set one on each pop. If using writing icing, wait for another 20 minutes or so until the white chocolate has set. To avoid a bloom on the chocolate, cover the cake pops in chocolate on the day you want to eat them  or the day before at the earliest.
Pipe on holly leaves with the green icing and two little dots for berries using the red. Once finished, store them in a cool place, though not the fridge",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/216106-556x370.jpg,216106,2022-11-13 05:19:04 UTC,2022-11-13 05:19:04 UTC,363
238,Basically Strawberry Shortcakes,"While shortcakes bake, make your strawberries and whipped cream. If whipping cream by hand, place a large bowl in freezer to chill. Trim and discard stems of 1 lb. strawberries. Cut smaller ones in half and larger ones into quarters. Transfer to a medium bowl. Cut reserved lemon in half and squeeze 2 Tbsp. lemon juice into bowl with strawberries. Add 3 Tbsp. sugar and toss to combine. Let sit at room temperature, tossing occasionally as you wait for the shortcakes. They will naturally create their own syrup through the mingling of the fruit juices with the sugar and lemon juice.

241,Chocolate pudding with spiced berry syrup,"Butter a 1lb pudding basin, then line the base with a circle of greaseproof paper. To prepare the steamer, place an upturned saucer into a large saucepan big enough to fit the pudding basin.

In a bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and creamy. Slowly add the beaten eggs, mixing well between each addition. Add the vanilla and melted chocolate and mix everything well. Sieve the cocoa, flour and baking powder into the mixture, then fold in the ground almonds, milk and chocolate buttons.

(Discard any unopened mussels.) Stir in parsley.Tips & NotesIngredient Note: Literally the stigma from Crocus sativus, saffron is the world's most expensive spice. Each crocus produces only 3 stigmas, requiring over 75,000 flowers for each pound of saffron. Fortunately, a little goes a long way. It's used sparingly to add golden yellow color and flavor to a wide variety of Middle Eastern, African and European-inspired foods. Find it in the specialty-herb section of large supermarkets, gourmet-food shops and www.tienda.com. Wrapped in foil and placed in a container with a tight-fitting lid, it will keep in a cool, dry place for several years.Tip: To clean mussels, scrub them with a stiff brush under cold running water. Scrape off any barnacles using the shell of another mussel. Just before cooking, pull off the fuzzy ""beard"" from each one (some mussels may not have a beard). Discard any mussels with broken shells or any that do not close when tapped.NutritionPer serving: 350 calories; 12 g fat (2 g sat, 7 g mono);64 mg cholesterol; 22 g carbohydrates; 29 g protein; 2 g fiber; 652 mg sodium; 534 mg potassium.Nutrition Bonus: Selenium (147% daily value), Iron (50% dv), Vitamin C (50% dv), Folate (32% dv), Zinc (22% dv), Vitamin A (20% dv).Carbohydrate Servings: 1 1/2Exchanges: 2 vegetable, 4 lean meatMore From EatingWellHealthy Fruit Bars RecipesThese healthy fruit bars are the perfect snack to put in your...Healthy Summer Dessert RecipesCelebrate summer with our summer dessert recipes made with...Top 50 Potluck RecipesThis collection of healthy potluck recipes is full of crowd-...Healthy Bean Salad RecipesThese healthy bean salad recipes bring fresh summery life to the...Recipes for Healthy Brownies and BlondiesBrownies and blondies are crowd-pleasing desserts for any...Low-Calorie Pasta Salad RecipesOur low-calorie pasta salad recipes will be a favorite dish...Healthy Smoothie RecipesWhether you're looking for a quick breakfast or a refreshing...Healthy Iced Tea RecipesA tall glass of iced tea on a hot day is refreshing, and it...10-Minute Breakfast RecipesIf youre in a rush and thinking about skipping breakfast,...Granola Bar Recipes and Power Bar RecipesUsing healthy ingredients such as nuts, dried fruit and whole...Healthy Spinach RecipesSpinach might have made Popeye strong, but what he probably...Mothers Day Brunch RecipesTheres no better way to celebrate Mothers Day than by...Good Skin Foods: Healthy Recipes for Glowing SkinSunscreen helps keep your skin healthy and beautiful,...Quick Light LunchesSave your waistline and your wallet with these quick and...Breakfast Casserole RecipesOur breakfast casserole recipes are a satisfying way to start...Easy Mexican Food FavoritesWe love Mexican meals, but often the differences between...Recipe CategoriesEthnic/RegionalAmericanEase of PreparationModerateHealth & Diet ConsiderationsDiabetes appropriateLow calorieLow cholesterolLow saturated fatHeart healthyHealthy weightHigh potassiumGluten freeTotal Time45 minutes or lessServings4Main IngredientShellfishPreparation/ TechniqueSauteSteamMeal/CourseDinnerSeasonSpringSummerFallWinterHolidayNew Year's EveStyle/ThemeEntertaining, casualEntertaining, formalType of DishMain dish, combination mealMain dish, fish/seafoodPublicationThe EatingWell Healthy in a Hurry Cookbook (2006)",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/698863-556x370.jpg,698863,2022-11-13 05:19:12 UTC,2022-11-13 05:19:12 UTC,288

Mix quickly. Do not worry if there are clumps or lumps. Over-mixing may cause the batter to become chewy when cooked.

Sprinkle squid pieces with flour. Use a small sieve to lightly dust the squid pieces with rice flour or regular flour. This will help the batter adhere to the squid.

Dip squid pieces in batter and fry in hot oil: Working in small batches at a time (about 6 pieces), dip the squid pieces in the batter. Pick them up one by one and gently put them in the hot oil. (Note if your fingers are coated with the batter, it will help protect them from splatter.)

When the squid pieces are in the oil, use a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon to dislodge any squid pieces that may have become stuck from the bottom of the pot or fryer. Fry for 45 seconds to 1 minute, and remove to paper towels to drain.
Note that when done, they will NOT be golden brown, but more of a pale yellow or tan.
Repeat with the rest of the squid. Working in batches will help keep the oil temperature from falling too far while you are frying the squid.

Serve immediately: Serve immediately with lime or lemon wedges, soy sauce, ponzu sauce, Tabasco or another hot sauce.
Once the cooking oil has completely cooled (after about 2 hours), strain it through a paper towel-lined sieve, and save it to reuse the next time you want to deep fry seafood.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/246306-556x370.jpg,246306,2022-11-13 05:19:23 UTC,2022-11-13 05:19:23 UTC,238

372,Sesame Noodle Salad,"Instructions

Combine all ingredients for dressing first. Cook spaghetti until al dente- you want it to be chewy, not soft and mushy. Drain pasta and toss with half of prepared dressing while its still warm. Set aside. In large bowl toss all vegetables together. Add in cooked spaghetti and mix. Pour in remaining dressing and toss to coat. At this point, it all should be luke warmish. Its really good like this, or you can refrigerate it until its cold. So, once you're ready to eat, top the salad with crushed ramen and cashews.

RECIPE TIPS:

- If you know your family won't eat the whole dish in one setting, don't top the entire thing with the ramen and cashews. They will get soggy and mushy and gross in the salad overnight and eating it the next day isn't all that delectable... unless you like soggy and mushy things, in which case you can ignore this whole thing.

- If you don't have cashews, then use almonds or peanuts. Just make sure they are raw and unsalted. The nuts are really quite an optional thing too, so if you don't have them on hand, its not the end of the world.

- Feel free to switch out the vegetables for ones your family will like/what you have in the fridge. The dressing is pretty strong so it makes vegetables more palatable for picky eaters.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/686054-556x370.jpg,686054,2022-11-13 05:19:29 UTC,2022-11-13 05:19:29 UTC,463

Slice the onion thinly and place in a small bowl. Cover with cold tap water and set aside for 10 minutes while you finish preparing the rest of the salad (this will keep the onion’s flavor but prevent the onion from having such a harsh, raw bite.) Drain the onion and lightly pat dry.

Slice the pomegranate in half across its “equator” (NOT top to bottom). Working one half at a time, turn the pomegranate over an empty bowl, cut side down, and squeeze it gently all the way around to loosen the seeds. With the back of a wooden spoon, firmly wrap the back of the pomegranate, knocking the seeds into the bowl (be careful—the juice can splatter). Rotate the pomegranate then repeat, so that you tap it all the way around and knock out as many seeds as possible. Slice the pomegranate into big wedges and remove any seeds you missed with your fingers. Repeat with the second half. Measure out ½ cup of the seeds for the recipe, then save the rest for a different use.

In a small bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients: olive oil, apple cider vinegar, mustard, honey, salt, and pepper. Alternatively, you can shake all of the ingredients together in a tightly sealed mason jar.

Cook for 1 to 2 minutes before adding in the chicken and the marinade. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes or until no longer pink.

Pour in the tomato puree and add the sugar. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.Stir in coconut milk and heat through. Serve butter chicken over cooked basmati rice with, naan and a sprinkle of torn cilantro leaves.**NOTE: I've also made it by marinating the meat in the ginger, garlic and spices (which is more typical). That's fine too!

586,Baked Eggs in Avocado with Bacon on Toast,"Directions

Pre-heat oven to 425F.

Crack the eggs in individual bowls, careful to not puncture the yolks. Set aside. You can crack the egg directly in the avocado later, but it might overflow and make a mess.

Cut avocado in half and carefully remove seed. Depending on how big the seed is, the hole in the avocado should be big enough for one small egg. But if the hole looks too small, scoop out a little at a time until it matches the amount of egg.

Make aluminum foil rings to hold the avocados level. You need to keep the avocado from tilting so that the raw egg does not spill out. Look out photos to see how we did it. In medium baking dish, lay foil ring, and rest the avocado half on top so that the avocado doesn't tilt over. Press down on foil if needed to align the avocado. 

Carefully place the eggs into the avocado seed cavities ~ If you aren't sure if the cavity is big enough to hold all the egg whites, this technique will be useful: With a spoon, gently scoop out one of the yolks and place it into the hole of the avocado. Then continue spooning the egg whites into the avocado hole until it's full. Repeat for other avocado half.

Add salt and fresh cracked black pepper on top of the eggs, to taste.

Carefully place the baking dish in oven and bake for about 15-30 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your preference. Baking time will vary depending on how much egg you have and how big your avocado is. So keep checking the egg to see if it's cooked to your desired consistency. Sometimes we bake them for less time because we like runny egg yolks. 

Sprinkle crumbled bacon on top. Spread the avocado/egg onto toast. Add addition salt and pepper to taste, chopped tomatoes, hot sauce, if needed. Enjoy!",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/589781-556x370.jpg,589781,2022-11-13 05:19:56 UTC,2022-11-13 05:19:56 UTC,340

The stock can be made a day ahead if you wish.

Place all stock ingredients into a stock pot and bring to a boil.

Lower to a simmer and skim off and discard brown foam that floats to the top.

Simmer stock for two hours.

After two hours, remove pork with tongs and set aside to cool.

Remove and discard three bay leaves.

Use an immersion blender and puree what remains in the pot. There should be exactly two quarts of pureed liquid. If there is more, place it back in the pot and slowly cook down to two quarts being careful that it doesn’t stick. If less than two quarts, make up the difference with water. Set aside for now.

Pick meat off of the bones and discard bones, fat and connecting tissue. Break the meat up with your fingers into bite sized or larger pieces and set aside.

In a 6-quart soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, add the olive oil and once hot, add the onions.

Cook the onions for five minutes or so until completely tender. It is OK if they start to brown.

Add the tomato paste and cook for three minutes stirring often so it doesn’t stick.

Add the stock and scrape any brown bits from the bottom. (If any sediment settled to the bottom of the stock container or pot, stop pouring before you get to it. I had a few peppercorns settle to the bottom which I discarded)

Add the two cans of crushed tomatoes, dill fronds and cooked pork.

Bring to a simmer and place a heat defuser under the pot and a splatter screen over the top and once simmering, cook 30 minutes. Try not to break up the pork too much.

Strain into a martini glass, and garnish with a basil leaf. If you have a tiny clothespin (heres a link) use that to fasten the basil leaf to the glass. If not, you could hang a lime wheel over the side and use a toothpick to attach the basil leaf to the lime.

Place the pan on the grill rack, bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook until reduced to a slightly thicker consistency, 15 to 20 minutes. Set the glaze aside (it will thicken slightly as it cools).                          For the mayonnaise:To make the mayonnaise, mix all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until serving.                          For the spinach:Mix the sesame dressing and ponzu sauce in a small bowl.

Stir in the miso and blend evenly. Spread the chuck out in a large, shallow pan. Distribute the miso mixture over the meat and sprinkle evenly with the green onion, ginger, garlic, pepper, and salt. Handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting it, mix well. Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions and, with cupped hands, toss 1 portion of the meat back and forth from hand to hand to form a loose ball. Pat the meat portion lightly on a flat surface to form a patty to fit the buns. Press the center of the patty down with your fingertips to create a slight indention in the center of the patty.

665,Scotch eggs,"Put 9 eggs into a large saucepan. Cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Once boiling, set the timer for 5 mins. When 5 mins is up, quickly lift the eggs out with a slotted spoon and plunge into a big bowl of cold water.
Put the sausagemeat, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder and mace into a bowl with plenty of seasoning. Break in 1 of the remaining eggs and mix everything together.
Crack remaining 2 eggs into a bowl, beat with a fork, then sieve onto a plate. Tip the flour onto another plate and season well. Finally, tip the breadcrumbs onto a third plate.
Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Drop in the bacon rashers, turn off the pan and fish out the bacon with a pair of tongs  it should be just cooked.
When the eggs are cool, tap lightly on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel (Picture A). If you hold the eggs over the bowl of water as you peel, all the shell bits will collect in there and you can dip in the egg to wash off any fragments. Wrap a slice of bacon around the middle of each egg, overlapping, like a belt (Picture B).
Now finish coating the eggs. I set up the ingredients along my bench like a conveyer belt: eggs, then flour, mince, beaten egg and finally breadcrumbs, plus a baking parchment-lined tray at the end to put the finished scotch eggs on.
Roll your bacon-wrapped eggs in the flour, shaking off excess. Take a good chunk of mince and pat out to thinly cover one hand. Sit the egg on the meat (Picture C), then mould over the mince to cover, squeezing and patting so it is an even thickness. Youll probably have a gap (depending on how big your hands are  just patch and pat with a bit more mince). Dip in the egg, shaking off the excess, then roll in the breadcrumbs to coat, and transfer to your tray. Repeat to cover all 9 eggs, then cover with cling film and chill for 4 hrs or overnight.
To cook, pour the oil in a large, deep saucepan to about 4cm deep. Heat until a small chunk of bread browns in about 1 min. Carefully lower in a scotch egg and fry for about 5 mins, turning gently, until evenly browned. Depending on your pan, you can probably do 2-3 at a time, but dont overcrowd. Lift out onto a kitchen paper-lined tray. (If you like your scotch eggs warm, pop them into a low oven while you fry the rest.) keep an eye on the oil  if the scotch eggs start browning too quickly, the oil might be too hot and you risk the pork not being cooked before the scotch egg is browned. If the oil gets too cool, the scotch egg may overcook before it is browned. enjoy warm or cold; best eaten within 24 hrs of frying.Watch our scotch egg video for an easy to follow tutorial.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/218303-556x370.jpg,218303,2022-11-13 05:20:04 UTC,2022-11-13 05:20:04 UTC,611

670,Chocolate Almond Milk,"Instructions

If you soaked the almonds first, drain and rinse well. You'll want to use fresh water (not the soaking water) when you make this recipe.

In a high-speed blender, combine the almonds, cacao powder, maple syrup, and water. Blend until completely smooth and creamy, about 1 full minute. (See the notes below for the date-sweetened version.)

Pour the chocolate milk mixture through a nut milk bag, and squeeze well until all of the liquid is removed, with only dry pulp remaining in the bag. Save the leftover almond pulp for one of the recipes mentioned in this post. You can also use a fine mesh strainer to strain out the almond pulp, if you don't have a nut milk bag, or try using cheesecloth.

Pour the chocolate almond milk into an airtight container and store it in the fridge to chill. It's natural for homemade almond milk to separate, so shake the container well to mix it back together before pouring.

This homemade milk can be saved for up to 4 days in the fridge, or you can pour whatever you won't use into an ice cube tray to freeze. Frozen cubes can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 months, and make a great addition to smoothies.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1463831-556x370.jpg,1463831,2022-11-13 05:20:05 UTC,2022-11-13 05:20:05 UTC,287

718,Aged Sriracha Hot Sauce,"Wash the chiles and chop off their stems. If you like your sauce less hot, remove the seeds and membranes and discard. Work the next step in 2 batches so you don't overload the food processor. Add the chiles,  garlic and salt to the food processor. Process for 2 minutes until very liquid. The mixture should have consistency of a smoothie and appear a bit foamy on top.Scrape the sauce into a very clean 1-quart (or larger) glass jar. Don't use plastic. Cover the top of jar with paper towel and secure with rubber band. This prevents bugs from entering and allows sauce to breathe. Place jar in cool, dark place for 2-4 days. The liquid will settle at bottom, and the thicker sauce will rise to top. The top should be bubbly - which is a sign of fermentation. Taste, and let sit for a few more days if desired. I prefer 7 days of fermentation.If mold grows, remove the mold with a small spoon - and then proceed to the next step (basically, don't eat the mold directly, but the sauce should be okay).Pour the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve. Now you'll have the thinner ""Tabasco"" like vinegary hot sauce and the thicker hot chile sauce. To each, add 3 tablespoons of vinegar and stir well.You may like to run the thicker sauce through the blender for a finer, thinner consistency. Store each tightly sealed in refrigerator. The thicker hot sriracha sauce will keep for up to 4 months. The thinner vinegar hot sauce will keep indefinitely. ",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/602152-556x370.jpg,602152,2022-11-13 05:20:09 UTC,2022-11-13 05:20:09 UTC,53

835,Mushroom Marsala Pasta Bake,"Make the sauce: Reheat your empty pasta pot over high heat. Add oil and once it is hot, add mushrooms and cook until theyve begun to brown and glisten, but have not yet released their liquid. Reduce heat to medium-high, add onions, salt and pepper and saute together until the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated. Add Marsala and cook mixture, stirring, until it has almost or fully evaporated (depending on your preference). Add butter, stir until melted. Add flour, and stir until all has been dampened and absorbed. Add stock, a very small splash at a time, stirring the whole time with a spoon. Make sure each splash has been fully mixed into the butter/flour/mushroom mixture, scraping from the bottom of the pan and all around, before adding the next splash. Repeat until all stock has been added. Let mixture simmer together for 2 minutes, stirring frequently; the sauce will thicken. Remove pan from heat.Assemble and bake dish: If youre cooking in an ovensafe dish, add cooked pasta and stir until combined. (If youre not cooking in an ovensafe dish, transfer this mixture to a 2-quart baking dish.) Stir in half the parmesan, all of the mozzarella and two tablespoons of the parsley until evenly mixed. Sprinkle the top with remaining parmesan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until edges of pasta are golden brown and irresistible. Sprinkle with reserved parsley and serve hot. Reheat as needed.A bunch of notes:Why marsala? Because its the Pantone Color of the Year 2015! More seriously, Marsala is a fortified wine from Sicily with a deep, complex flavor. It comes in dry and sweet versions; for savory dishes, use the dry. (For zabaglione, use the sweet. And invite me over.) It shares some commonalities with Sherry and Madeira, which arent exactly substitutes, but would also taste good here. You can buy dry Marsala it at wine shops inexpensively. I find that mine keeps open in the fridge for a year, but I have a feeling wine experts are grimacing. Seriously, though, ours still tastes for cooking great very long after its been opened and thats all I need to know.We dont consume or cook with alcohol: Heres what Im not going to say, But the alcohol cooks off! as most recipes will tell you because it, yes, it largely/mostly does, but not completely. Since Im cooking for a mixed-age family, I cook mine down to nonexistence (Im after the flavor, not a nap, though naps = swoon, you know?) but I know that many people will not want to use it at all. And you dont have to. This dish will still be incredibly delicious without it. If youre looking to try something clever/delicious in a different way, you might rehydrate a few dried porcinis in 1/4 cup boiling water. Remove them, chop them find and add them to the other mushrooms for a louder mushroom flavor. Then, strain the porcini soaking liquid to remove any sand/grit, add 1 teaspoon sherry or red wine vinegar and use this instead of the Marsala for a little extra flavor oomph.If it werent me making this: You might add some diced cooked chicken to the final baking portion. I personally am incredibly put off by chicken in pasta dishes, but seriously this is no time to start opening the terrifying large can of Implausible Things Deb Doesnt Like.See more: Mushrooms, Pasta, Photo, Vegetarian, Weeknight Favorite, WinterDo more: Link | Bookmark| Pin | Print| Email| 66 Comments",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/625334-556x370.jpg,625334,2022-11-13 05:20:19 UTC,2022-11-13 05:20:19 UTC,526

840,"Smoked Mozzarella, Pancetta and Kale Pizza","Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat.Heat a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crisp, stirring often, about 8-10 minutes. Transfer the pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate, and drain all but a tablespoon or two of grease from the pan.Return the pan to the heat, and sauté the garlic in the remaining grease for 30 seconds or until just fragrant.  Add the kale and cook until just wilted.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and remove from the heat.If not using a pre-cooked crust, form two pizza rounds by rolling out the dough on a lightly floured surface until they are 10 to 12-inches in diameter and about a 1/2 inch thick. You may wish to roll out the second one while the first is baking. Remember to place on the peel or sheet pan before you add toppings.  (You may also follow the directions for the gluten-free crust; see linked recipe, above.) Once in the desired shape, place on parchment-lined baking sheets.  If using a pizza stone, place the pizzas, one at a time, on a pizza peel–or on a cool, upside-down sheet pan–dusted with cornmeal. Use enough cornmeal so that dough does not stick to the surface.Drizzle the pizza dough or the prepared crusts with the olive oil.  Scatter the mozzarella cheese evenly over the top of each pizza, followed by the sautéed kale and crisp pancetta.Transfer the pizza to the oven. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted and bubbly.  If using precooked crusts, bake for approximately 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.Once one pizza is out of the oven, proceed with the second pizza. Cut the pizzas into quarters or eighths. Transfer to plates and serve warm.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/602760-556x370.jpg,602760,2022-11-13 05:20:20 UTC,2022-11-13 05:20:20 UTC,818
