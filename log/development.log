Skim as much fat as you can.\nIn a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and 1 tbs. of water till completely smooth.\nPour the cornstarch mixture into the bowl of sauce and stir to combine.\nReduce the sauce quickly in a saucepan on the stovetop by simmering it to 10 minutes.\nPour the sauce over the brisket and serve.\nThe leftovers make great BBQ sandwiches.\nIf you like crockpot food, be sure to check out some of my favorite recipes at www.mealdiva.com"], ["image_url", "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/634486-556x370.jpg"], ["created_at", "2022-10-28 02:46:51.048938"], ["updated_at", "2022-10-28 02:46:51.048938"]]

By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).</li><li>Custard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.</li><li>Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.</li><li>Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.</li></ol>"], ["image_url", "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/632625-556x370.jpg"], ["created_at", "2022-10-28 02:47:51.210591"], ["updated_at", "2022-10-28 02:47:51.210591"]]

Once the eggs are thickened, take the bowl off the water and set aside.</li><li>Poach the eggs:</li><li>Fill a medium saucepan with water, add a splash of white vinegar (optional, but this helps hold the whites together which results in nicely shaped eggs) and bring to a gentle simmer. You want tiny bubbles only, not a rolling boil. Gently add eggs to water and poach until deisred doneness.</li><li>Meanwhile, toast bread.</li><li>Place toast on plates and top with arugula, spinach and salmon.

Place peppers evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place under broiler. Watch them closely as the skin will blister and turn black within minutes. Turn the peppers after 5 minutes to blister all sides evenly. When done, the pepper skins should be evenly blistered and mostly black. Place roasted peppers in a plastic bag, cover with a kitchen towel and when cool, rub off blackened skin. Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.\nSauce\nIn a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.\nOven Style\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.\nPour 2 cups of the sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco and bake until warm, about 15 minutes.

By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).</li><li>Custard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.</li><li>Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.</li><li>Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.</li></ol>"], ["image_url", "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/632625-556x370.jpg"], ["created_at", "2022-10-28 03:47:15.697307"], ["updated_at", "2022-10-28 03:47:15.697307"]]

Select firm, meaty peppers without wrinkles for roasting. Wash thoroughly. Place peppers evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place under broiler. Watch them closely as the skin will blister and turn black within minutes. Turn the peppers after 5 minutes to blister all sides evenly. When done, the pepper skins should be evenly blistered and mostly black. Place roasted peppers in a plastic bag, cover with a kitchen towel and when cool, rub off blackened skin. Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.\nSauce\nIn a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.\nOven Style\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.\nPour 2 cups of the sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco and bake until warm, about 15 minutes. Serve with a dollop of crema or sour cream and your favorite side dish."], ["image_url", "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/642403-556x370.jpg"], ["created_at", "2022-10-28 03:48:17.122410"], ["updated_at", "2022-10-28 03:48:17.122410"]]
